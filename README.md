Multilingual Chatbot for the Norwegian Constitution
This project is a specialized chatbot designed to answer questions directly from a PDF of the Norwegian Constitution. It's built for individuals who wish to learn about Norwegian law but are hindered by the English language barrier, particularly those who speak Bengali and Norwegian.

Our primary goal is to make legal information more accessible to Bengali and Norwegian speakers by providing them with a tool that can explain complex legal topics in their native languages.

Key Features
Multilingual Support: Interact with the chatbot in Bengali (bn), English (en), and Norwegian (no).
